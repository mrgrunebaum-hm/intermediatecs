This page should include all LISP forms that you may need in Intermediate.

LISP ('List Processing', 1960) is a functional programming language designed by John McCarthy. We will be using the Common Lisp dialect (clisp).

### Atoms
```common-lisp
t                ;; true
nil              ;; false
A, Lion, roar    ;; symbols
```

### Quoted Forms
```common-lisp
'abc             ;; Unevaluated symbol
'(1 2 3)         ;; The list (1 2 3), which is not evaluated.  So:
                       (+ 1 2)  =>  3
                      '(+ 1 2)  =>  (+ 1 2)
```

### Arithmetic Expressions
```common-lisp
(+ e1 ... en)   ;; Sum the numbers e1 ... en.  (*,-,/ are all similar)

                    (+ 1 2 3)  =>  6
```

Other operators such as ```mod```, ```sin```, ```sqrt```, ```expt``` etc.

### Boolean Expressions
```common-lisp
(eq x y)        ;; Returns t if x and y are the same number or 
                ;; the same list.  Note: there are other equality
                ;; tests, but you should use eq for this class

                        (eq 1 1)  =>  t
                        (eq 1 2)  =>  nil
                      (eq 'A 'A)  =>  t
                      (eq 'A 'B)  =>  nil
                    (eq nil nil)  =>  t

(< x y)         ;; Arithmetic comparison. 
                ;; (Other simple ops include: >, >=, or, and, not)

                        (< 1 2)  =>  t
                        (< 2 1)  =>  nil

(atom x)        ;; Return t if x is an atom and nil if x is a list

                                (atom 'A)  =>  t
                               (atom nil)  =>  t
                    (atom (car '(A nil)))  =>  t        ;; car/cdr to be explained below
                    (atom (cdr '(A nil)))  =>  nil

(member x l)    ;; Return nil if x is not in the list,
                ;; or t (or some other non-nil value) if x is
                ;; in the list.

                        (member 'A '(A B))  =>  t
                        (member 'C '(A B))  =>  nil
```

### Lists
```common-lisp
nil             ;; The empty list

(cons x ls)     ;; The list containing x, followed by the elements in ls

                             (cons 'A nil)  =>  (A)
                             (cons 'A (B))  =>  (A B)
                            (cons nil nil)  =>  (nil)

(car ls)        ;; The first element of the list ls
                ;; In Scala we use ls.head()
                
                               (car '(A B C))  =>  A
                        (car (cons A '(B C)))  =>  A

(cdr ls)        ;; The list ls, excluding the first element
                ;; In Scala we use ls.tail()
                
                                    (cdr nil)  =>  nil
                               (cdr '(A B C))  =>  (B C)
                        (cdr (cons A '(B C)))  =>  (B C)

(append l1 l2)  ;; The list containing the elements from l1, 
                ;; followed by the elements from l2

                    (append '(A B) '(C D))  =>  (A B C D)

(length ls)     ;; The length of the list

                                 (length nil)  =>  nil
                            (length '(A B C))  =>  3
```

### Conditionals
```common-lisp
(cond (p1 e1) ... (pn en))  ;; Evaluates each p in order until it finds
                            ;; a true expression.  It then evaluates the
                            ;; expression for that guard:

                                (cond ((eq 0 1) 2) (t 3))  =>  3
                                (cond ((eq 0 0) 2) (t 3))  =>  2


(if p e1 e2)                ;; More readable syntax for a cond defining 
                            ;; the usual "if-then-else".  Use cond if you 
                            ;; have more than two conditions to test.
                            ;; Use if when you have an if and else only.

                                         (if (eq 0 1) 2 3)  =>  3
                                         (if (eq 0 0) 2 3)  =>  2
```

### Function Definitions
```common-lisp
(defun f ls body)          ;; Defines a function named f, with arguments ls

                            (defun distance (x1 y1 x2 y2) 
                                    (sqrt (+ (expt (- x2 x1) 2) (expt (- y2 y1) 2))))

                            (defun mult(x y) (* x y))
```
