Let's make sure your computer is set up! We'll be going over what everything is in class.

## Visual Studio Code
This is the IDE we'll be using for this class, but if you are comfortable with another, feel free to stick with what you are using.

  1. [Click on this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the version corresponding to your computer.

## Scala
We will be using [Scala 2](https://www.scala-lang.org/). Make sure your computer environment is properly set up to compile and run Scala programs.
  
  1. Install the `Scala (Metals)` extension for VS Code.
  1. Check that your computer has Java installed by running `java --version` in your terminal. 
      1. If you see something like "java 15.0.1 2020-10-20" as the first line, then you have Java installed and can move on to the next step. 
      1. If you see something to the effect of "command not found", then you need to download the correct version of Java to your computer from [this link for Mac OS X](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11-mac) or [this link for Windows](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11-windows).
  1. Follow [these instructions](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) for installing Coursier.
  1. Run `./cs install cs` in your terminal.
  1. Run `./cs setup` in your terminal.
  1. Close your terminal window and reopen it
  1. Check your installation by running `scala` in your terminal. A `scala` shell should pop up. You can exit by typing `:quit`.

## Homebrew (optional, for Mac users)
Homebrew is a useful software package manager for Apple machines â€“ if you run into any trouble with the above steps for installing Coursier and running Scala, you may wish to try a 'brew install'. 

  1. Download Homebrew by following the steps at this [link](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). 
  1. Once finished, follow the instructions for '[mac OS - brew based installation](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation#macos-brew-based-installation)' of Coursier. 

## Organization
On your desktop (or preferred folder), create a new folder titled `Intermediate`. This is where you'll keep all your files for this course.
